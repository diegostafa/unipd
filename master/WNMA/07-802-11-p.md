## 802.11 p - vanet

props:
* designed for VANET --> high mobility
* reserved frequencies to avoid interference

requirements
* constrained delays for error messages
* can handle multiple AV (abnormal vehicles)
* broadcast the AV alert to every other node

broadcasting can be done with:
* MCDS
* fast broadcast --> probabilistic
* robust fast forward --> deterministic

## MCDS - minimum connected dominating set

* mcds = min set where each node has a connection to
* only broadcast in mcds
* needs complete knowledge of the network
* slow to compute

## fast broadcast protocol

hello message content:
* CMBR --> maximum backward range
* CMFR --> maximum forward range

alert message content:
* EMTR --> estimate maximum transmission range --> maxRange - CMBR

estimation phase:
* every vehicle send an hello message
* upon receiving an hello message
    * set the CMBR to: max between: current CMBR, hello message CMFR, distance between the vehicles

broadcast phase:
* alert message is emitted
* give smaller backoff values for vehicle with high tx range
* only reboradcast if no one else retransmitted and backoff expired

## ROFF - RObust fast forwarding

uses priorities instead of backoff timers
