## EDCA

each device has a priority
* AC_V0 --> voip
* AC_V1 --> video
* AC_BE --> best effort
* AC_BG --> background, slow speed

priority influence
* win_size
* AIFSN --> the DIFS
* bursting --> use the channel continuosly

props:
* problem when multiple devices have the same priority, solved by admission control

## admission control

* specified by a bit in the periodic beacon
* the device that wants a specific priority must pass the admission control algorithm

## HCCA

* use hcf (similar to pcf)
* polling can be instantiated whenever the AP want
* more flexible than
* more quality of service compared to pcf

## 802.11n

* higher data rate
* bigger channels
* legacy mode
* mimo

## mimo - multiple in multiple out

* the physicial layer allow for multiple antennas in the board
* more speed or parallel communication
* need sync
* more reliable
