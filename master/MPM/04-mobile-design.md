## desktop vs mobile

props
* screen size
* computation power
* energy consumption
* OS
* input (touch, sensors, voice)

## ui

good
* inside thumb zone --> good controls
* outside thumb zone --> unwanted controls and make them bigger
* content always on top --> covered controls should be displayed above the finger
* few screen interactions
* bigger screen --> group controls together
* bigger controls --> if outside the comfort zone or if grouped
* JIT interface --> only show relevant controls
* progressive disclosure --> details should be hidden at first
* gestures
    * easy
    * avoid miss inputs
    * don't take up screen space
    * they can be memorized
    * shortcuts
    * shoould follow OS conventions
* provide undo operations
* conventions
* circle menus
    * for games
    * not scalable
    * hard to learn
    * needs muscle memory
* skeumorphic design --> familiar design to the user
* "looks like" should "act like"

bad
* using buttons over gestures
* hover events --> can't be easily detected
* infinite scroll
* carousel, unless specific cases (random items, forms)
* long forms --> hard to reach every field
* keyboard, slow
* controls covering content
* tutorial
* "act like" not necessarly should "looks like"

## ux

coaching
* show the feature
* ask the user to perform it
* (expensive) if the user makes an error show the solution

leveling up
* show features only if some requirements are met

power up
* shortcuts

sensors
* ui/ux should adapt based on what the device can do

## emotional design

* the app working is the minimum, the app should have more qualities
* amygdala
    * handle basic needs
    * manifests in emotions
    * store informations related to emotions
    * ui needs to stimulate this
* does not work if really bad situations

maslow pyramid
* enjoyable
* usable
* reliable
* functional

techiniques
* humanization
* product personality
* archetypes
* good emotions
* incentive good decisions
