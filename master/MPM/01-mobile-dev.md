## web, mobile and desktop

general info:
* web surfing is mainly done with the phone, but desktop takes a large part too
* device type usage depends on age, daytime
* mobile dev is hard and expensive, can require a team
* more users use android, but people spend more money on ios
* mobile apps have higher competion

## app development

process:
* project idea + design + dev + deployment
* design, dev, and deploy are repeated in native

apps can be classified in multiple way. the easy classification:
* web
* interpreted
* hybrid
* cross compiled
* native

web props
* easy to develop and deploy
* available in all platforms
* requires internet (unless PWA)
* hard to test
* non native ui
* no store

interpreted props
* web app which runs inside a native webview with a js interpreter
* can use the store
* it is used alongside the web apporach to publish the app in the store
* integrates well with other apps

cross compiled props
* one language to rule them all
* api to native features
* apple requires an apple device anyway
* performance depend on the platform compiler, usually less optimized than native
* higher energy consumption

native props
* native look
* can access mobile features and sensors
* increase brand fidelty
* much more performant
* os is much more strict tha a desktop app
* android has high device fragmentation

other classification
* trans compiled --> convert the source code the desired source code
* component based --> basically it's an app engine that uses premade components
* cloud based --> all the computation is done in remote servers
