## computer vision

* classifier that works on images
* classification problems --> brightness, scale, perspective...

image representation
* rgb histogram --> does not handle lighting
* function representation --> pixel(x, y) = color

image filtering
* apply a function on each pixel

neural networks image processing
* normal NN --> each layers does something (primitives, colors, lights)
* convolution NN --> convolution + pooling layers
