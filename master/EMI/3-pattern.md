## analysis of networks

graph representation, give insights on
* size
* structure
* general overview of connections
* density of the network

## types of innovation

can be (not exclusive):
* product or process innovation
* radical or incremental
* competence enhancing or destroying
* architectural or component

## product innovation or process innovation

product innovation:
* the innovation is the output (service/goods)
* can create process innovation
* other organizations can benefit from this

process innvoation:
* the innovation are the techniques used to make products
* can create product innovation
* other firms can benefits

note:
* they happen together
* usually one implies the other
* example --> phone/agile

## radical or incremental

incremental
* introduces minor changes on existing products

radical:
* it's riskier
* depends on time

note:
* radicalness --> how much different is the innovation from existing products
* radicalness is relative
* example --> processors/touchscreen

## competence enhancing or competence destroying

competence enhancing:
* it's built upon the KB

competence destroying:
* renders the KB obsolete

note:
* exmaple --> processors/new algorithm

## architectural or component

componnent:
* affects a specific part of the system

architectural:
* affects the overall design

note:
* architectural are also competence destroying and radical usually
* example --> bycicle seat/new model

## technology trajectory

it's the lifecycle of a technology over time, in the S-curve the trasjectory is defined by the perfomance and effort over time

## s-curve (performance)

defines the performance of a product over the effort spent over time

note:
* the curve explain the understanding of the technology
* it doesn't always reach its peak
* steeper curves means

## incumbent technology

technology that is well established

## incumbent firm

well established firm in a particular area, they usually don't switch because:
* new technology might show lower performance at first
* they have invested in their incumbent technology

## discontinuos technology

radical innovation that better fulfills a need, usually:
* increase the performance of something
* decrease the cost of something
* the s-curve has an higher performance

## s-curve (diffusion)

defines the adoption of a technology over time,  it describes the category of adopters
* innovators 
* early adopters --> experts
* early majority --> interactions
* late majority --> skepticals
* laggards --> the only decide on past experience

adoption depends on:
* advantages
* switch effort
* copatibility

## s-curves limits

* true limits of a technology are unknown
* not everything follows the s function
* dogamtically following the curve might cause bad decisions

## technology cycle

can be divided in
* fluid phase --> competition, uncertainty and experimental phase
* specific phase --> incremental imporvement to it (after become dominant)

note:
* not everyone follows this model
* dominant design can be bad
* the more you focus on a product the less you are willing to switch
