## effective procedure

algorithm than describe the computation of a function

## computable function

function that can be computed by an effective procedure

synonyms:
* effective function
* decidable function
* recursive function

## decidable predicate

a predicate is decidable if the characteristic function is computable

## algebra of decidability

algebraic operation to computable predicates are computable:
* Q and Q
* Q or Q
* not Q

## church turing thesis

* a function is computable by an algorithm iff it is computable by any computational model
* turing machine programs describe effective procedures

## computational model

models of computation that define the same class of computable functions
* turing machine
* lambda calculus
* partial recursive functions
* deduction system
* urm
